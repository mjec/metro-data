 Dear RTI officer

 I'm looking for information on on-time performance (i.e. whether buses are
 departing from stops early, on-time or late).

 I have looked for this information on the Metro website and in the Metro
 annual report but have been unable to find anything, even in summary or
 aggregate.

 I am seeking access to the following information in particular:

  (1) All existing documents detailing procedures by which on-time
 performance is measured
  (2) All existing documents detailing on-time performance targets
  (3) All existing documents summarising on-time performance during the
 2012-13 Financial Year, including (if available) breakdowns by time
 (quarter, month, week, day, time of day) and geography (region, area, route)
  (4) All existing documents with raw on-time performance data, including
 spreadsheets or database dumps where available, for the 2012-13 Financial
 Year

 It's my preference for this to be made available outside the assessed
 disclosure process. However, if assessed disclosure is required then please
 take this as my application for assessed disclosure.

 If this is treated as an assessed disclosure application then I wish to
 apply for a fee waiver on the basis that the information I am seeking is of
 general public interest. I intend to make this information publicly
 available online, permitting analysis and comparison with other public
 transport providers.

 I prefer to receive information in electronic form by email to this address
 (I do not need hard copies). I can be contacted by the following means:

 Email: [removed]
 Phone: [removed]
 Post: [removed]

 I am happy to discuss any aspect of this request; again, email is preferred.

 Many thanks

 Michael Cordover
