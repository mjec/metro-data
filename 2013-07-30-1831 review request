Dear Craig

Thank you for your response.


I would ask you to reconsider the waiver of the fee.

Public interest
I believe that this information would be of general public interest. I asked briefly on Twitter (https://twitter.com/mjec/status/359857953068679169) and received responses from eight people who were interested in seeing or analysing this information. This type of information is required to be published by other public transport providers in Australia (e.g. http://www.metrotrains.com.au/performance for Melbourne, http://www.statetransit.info/performance-information for Sydney). In the 2011-12 Annual Report Heather Haselgrove's second paragraph notes the importance of buses running on time, though there is no disclosure of this information. This clearly indicates an acceptance that there is a general public interest in Metro services running on time. There must therefore be a public interest in the release of performance data.


Impecunious applicant
I am in financial hardship. I am currently a full time student in receipt of Austudy (a Centrelink allowance). I receive a small amount of income (approximately $200 per month net) from contract work. I have no other source of income. I can provide evidence of this on request.


Please let me know whether you still wish to levy the fee. If so please advise if it can be paid by credit card and if so how I should do that.



Kind regards

Michael
